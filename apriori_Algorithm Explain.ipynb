    "The Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm used in data mining for association rule learning. It’s designed to extract frequent itemsets from a large dataset, often used in market basket analysis, movies & post recommendation, etc to discover relationships between different items. \n",
    "The algorithm aims to find associations between products or events that commonly occur together, such as \"if a customer buys bread, they often also buy butter.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is breakdown into three sections: the support, confidence and the lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support: This is a measure of how often an itemset appears in the dataset. It is mathematically define as: \n",
    "$$\\frac{the  number of transactions in the dataset that contain the itemset}{total number of transaction}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If 100 transactions were made and 25 of them included {milk, bread}, the support for {milk, bread} is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{25}{100} = 0.25$\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence: This measures the likelihood that an item B is also bought when item A is bought. It is mathematicaly define as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$confidence = \\frac{Support(𝐴∪𝐵)}{(Support(𝐴)}$$\n",
    "If 30 out of 50 transactions that include milk also include bread, the confidence of {milk} → {bread} is 30/50 = 0.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lift: This indicates how much more likely item B is to be bought when item A is bought, compared to buying B independently. (confidence / support)\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "$$Lift(𝐴→𝐵) = \\frac{Support(𝐴∪𝐵)}{(Support(𝐴)×Support(𝐵)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A lift greater than 1 indicates a strong association, while a lift equal to 1 suggests independence between items.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The algorithm has four steps\n",
    "1. Set a minimum support and confidence.\n",
    "2. Take all the subsets in transactions having higer support than minimum support.\n",
    "3. Take all the rules of these subsets having confidence than minimum confidence.\n",
    "4. Sort the rules by decreasing lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applications of Apriori\n",
    "1. Market Basket Analysis: Used to find products frequently purchased together, guiding product placement and promotions in retail.\n",
    "2. Recommendation Systems: Suggesting products based on user preferences.\n",
    "3. Healthcare: Identifying frequently co-occurring symptoms or diseases.\n",
    "4. Fraud Detection: Finding patterns in fraudulent behavior."
